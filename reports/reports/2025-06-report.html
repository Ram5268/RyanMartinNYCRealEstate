June 2025 Market Report
By June, financial markets were grappling with cross-currents. Globally, central banks struck a cautious tone. The European Central Bank, for instance, kept its key rate unchanged and noted that eurozone inflation had eased back to 2%, achieving its target (reuters.com). However, policymakers remained wary of trade disputes – U.S.–EU trade talks were ongoing, and the prospect of new tariffs (rumored 15% duties on European goods) threatened Europe’s growth outlook (reuters.com). In the U.S., oil prices ticked up amid Middle East tensions, adding some volatility. Overall, the international backdrop featured moderate growth and contained inflation, but with plenty of uncertainty due to geopolitical frictions.
In the U.S., evidence of a mild economic slowdown mounted in June. The Labor Department’s May jobs report (released in early June) showed payroll growth downshifting: only 139,000 jobs were added in May, roughly half the pace of early spring (reuters.com). Revisions revealed that hiring in March and April was 95,000 jobs lower than previously estimated (reuters.com), and June’s report would later show the first monthly job losses in over four years. The unemployment rate stayed at 4.2%, but only because over 600,000 Americans left the labor force amid waning confidence in the job market (reuters.com). Surveys showed businesses growing more cautious on hiring, citing uncertainty from President Trump’s flip-flopping tariffs and spending policies (reuters.com). On the price front, inflation crept up yet remained near target. May’s CPI came in at +2.4% year-over-year (up slightly from April’s 2.3%) with core inflation at 2.8% (cbsnews.comcbsnews.com). Notably, this moderate inflation reading fell short of forecasts, suggesting that the first round of tariff increases had not fully filtered through to consumer prices (cbsnews.com). Fed Chair Jerome Powell remarked that, so far, tariffs had not “shown up” in the backward-looking data but warned they could boost inflation in coming months (cbsnews.com). Indeed, economists projected that the inflation rate would edge above 3% by year’s end once the tariff effects materialize (cbsnews.com).
The Federal Reserve, therefore, held interest rates steady at its mid-June policy meeting, keeping the federal funds rate in the 4.25%–4.50% range (reuters.com). This marked the second consecutive meeting without a change. Importantly, the Fed’s updated projections still showed two rate cuts likely by the end of 2025, reflecting expectations that economic risks were rising (reuters.com). Fed officials emphasized a patient stance as they assessed “stagflation” concerns – inflation was trending a bit higher due to tariffs even as growth showed signs of cooling. Powell noted that the risks of higher inflation and higher unemployment had grown since the spring, creating a challenging outlook (cbsnews.com). In this context, the Fed signaled it would not hesitate to ease policy if downside risks materialize, but also that it wanted to wait for more data on the tariff impact before making any moves (cbsnews.com). Financial markets, which had hoped for an early rate cut, pulled back those expectations, pricing in policy easing only in the fall.
New York City’s real estate market remained heated in June, though new dynamics emerged. Manhattan’s median rent hit $4,625 – yet another record high (the fourth time in five months) and 7.6% higher than June 2024 (brickunderground.com). Renters continued to face intense competition: about 1 in 4 Manhattan apartments rented in June saw bidding wars driving the lease above the asking rent (brickunderground.com). A notable development was the implementation of New York’s new FARE Act (Fairness in Apartment Rental Expenses) on June 11, which shifted broker fee responsibility from renters to landlords. Many landlords promptly raised rents on new leases to offset the broker fees (brickunderground.com). This regulatory change likely contributed to the month’s rent surge and could temporarily tighten inventory as market participants adjust. On the sales side, NYC’s housing prices stayed resilient – Manhattan co-op/condo median sale prices showed little change year-on-year, and buyer demand proved steady for well-priced homes (helped by slightly lower mortgage rates compared to 2024). NYC’s local economy gave mixed signals: the city’s unemployment rate ticked down to 4.7% by June (edc.nyc), and private-sector payrolls stood near record highs, yet job growth in the first half of 2025 was the slowest (ex-pandemic) since 2009 (pfnyc.org). In summary, June ended with a growing sense that the economy was at an inflection point. For real estate clients, the implication is twofold: mortgage rates remained elevated for now (with the Fed on hold), but relief could be on the horizon if economic softness prompts late-year rate cuts; and NYC’s rental market, while still historically expensive, may start to stabilize once the broker-fee law’s impact normalizes and as affordability pressures eventually curb further rent hikes. All eyes will be on incoming data, as the Fed’s next steps – and the trajectory of interest rates – hinge on whether tariff-driven inflation materializes and how much the labor market cools over the summer.
