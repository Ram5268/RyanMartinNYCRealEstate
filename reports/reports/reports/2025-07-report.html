July 2025 Market Report
The global economic picture in July featured a mix of robust and artificial growth signals. Notably, the U.S. reported a surprising rebound in GDP: after shrinking at a –0.5% annual rate in Q1, the economy expanded by +3.3% (annualized) in Q2 2025 (cbsnews.com). This sharp snap-back in growth was largely a statistical mirage, driven by trade fluctuations. In Q1, many businesses front-loaded imports before tariffs hit, and that import surge dragged GDP down; in Q2, imports plunged nearly 30%, boosting growth by over 5 percentage points (cbsnews.com). Aside from trade distortions and an ongoing investment boom in AI, underlying demand remained tepid – the economy grew only ~1.4% on average in the first half (cbsnews.com). Europe’s economy, meanwhile, continued on a modest 1% growth path. With eurozone inflation back near 2%, the European Central Bank held its deposit rate at 2.0% in late July (reuters.com), after a year of easing. ECB officials took a data-dependent stance, noting that domestic price pressures were easing (wage growth had slowed) (reuters.com). Investors still bet on at least one more ECB rate cut by year-end, given that Trump’s trade war was weighing on European growth and threatening a new 15% tariff regime (reuters.com). In sum, global conditions in July showed contained inflation and central banks on hold, but with plenty of uncertainty under the surface of strong-looking headline GDP numbers.
In the United States, the inflation tide began to turn upwards due to import tariffs. Consumer prices in June (reported mid-July) rose 2.7% year-over-year, a noticeable pickup from May’s 2.4% pace (reuters.com). This marked the fastest inflation since January and confirmed that tariff pass-through was starting – prices for various goods (e.g. groceries, appliances, apparel) moved higher as businesses began to factor in the cost of Trump’s new import duties (reuters.comreuters.com). Core CPI reached +2.9% year-on-year (reuters.com). Notably, June’s price index was pushed up partly by a 1.0% rebound in gasoline (after months of declines), exacerbated by a mid-year jump in oil prices tied to Middle East unrest (reuters.cominvestopedia.com). Despite this inflation uptick, Federal Reserve officials expressed confidence that the tariff-driven price increases would be “meaningful but not persistent.” In minutes from its late-June meeting (released in July), the Fed indicated it expects inflation to run above target in coming months before fading in 2026, assuming the tariff shock is one-off (reuters.comreuters.com).
Labor market data signaled further cooling. The June jobs report (out in early July) showed only 73,000 jobs added (after revisions) – far below trend and evidence that hiring had almost stalled (cbsnews.com). The unemployment rate remained around 4.2%–4.3%, but more workers were on the sidelines and job openings had begun to decline. With economic momentum appearing to slow, markets increasingly anticipated that the Federal Reserve would cut rates at its next meeting. Indeed, by late July it was a near-consensus on Wall Street that the Fed’s first rate reduction of the year would occur in September (cbsnews.com). For its part, the Fed stayed on hold at the July 29–30 FOMC meeting, keeping the benchmark rate at 4.25%–4.50%. However, the internal debate intensified: “a couple” of Fed officials favored cutting rates as soon as July – a minority view – while the majority opted to wait for more evidence of a downturn (reuters.com). Fed Chair Jerome Powell, in his late-July press conference, struck a cautious tone, emphasizing that while inflation had ticked up, softening labor market trends and “fragile” business confidence warranted vigilance. In essence, the Fed pivoted from a hiking bias earlier in the year to a clear easing bias by July. The stage was set for potential rate cuts in the fall if the economy continued to lose steam.
New York City’s real estate market experienced record highs – and early hints of a cooldown. In Manhattan, rents peaked yet again: July’s median rent hit $4,700, the fifth record high in six months and up 9.3% year-over-year (brickunderground.com). The rental market’s intensity was unprecedented – nearly 29% of new Manhattan leases involved bidding wars in July, a record share since tracking began in 2021 (brickunderground.com). Many renters were offering above asking rent to secure apartments, driving summer rents higher earlier than usual. Nevertheless, inventory was gradually improving (Manhattan listings were ~10% higher than a year ago), and landlords started to show signs of pricing cautiously heading into late summer. The buy side of NYC’s market showed glimmers of strength thanks to the changing interest rate climate. Mortgage rates, while still high, dipped slightly on expectations of Fed cuts. This led to a jump in purchase activity: Manhattan home sales contracts in late July reached their highest level in nearly two years, as some would-be renters turned to buying, sensing a window before borrowing costs potentially fall further (credaily.combrickunderground.com). Overall, NYC’s economy in July remained on solid footing – tourism was bustling and Wall Street profits were up – but the city is not immune to national trends. Private-sector hiring in NYC slowed to a crawl (fewer than 1,000 net new jobs in the first half, per city data), aligning with the national cooldown (pfnyc.org). Forecast: By late summer, the pieces were in place for a shift in the market. The Fed’s likely rate cuts could lower mortgage rates, providing relief to buyers and refinancers. In turn, some downward pressure on rents may emerge if more renters become homeowners. For now, NYC clients should be prepared for one more month of very high rents in August, but with a reasonable expectation that relief – in the form of both lower interest rates and a plateauing of rent levels – is on the horizon as economic gravity finally sets in.
