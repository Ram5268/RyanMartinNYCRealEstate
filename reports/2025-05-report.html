May 2025 Market Report
Globally, economic activity showed resilience amid trade tensions. China’s economy grew by 5.4% year-on-year in Q1 2025 (reuters.com), although uncertainty loomed from an escalating U.S.–China tariff battle. In Europe, inflation hovered near target levels (~2%), allowing the European Central Bank to hold steady. The broad backdrop was one of cautious optimism, with major economies growing moderately despite geopolitical headwinds.
In the United States, the Federal Reserve maintained its benchmark interest rate at 4.25%–4.50% in early May, pausing after its last cut in December (cbsnews.com). Fed officials cited rising economic uncertainty from President Trump’s trade policies, which threatened to spur higher inflation and unemployment, as a key reason for adopting a “wait-and-see” stance (cbsnews.com). Notably, inflation had decelerated – the April Consumer Price Index rose just 2.3% year-over-year, the lowest since February 2021 (cbsnews.comcbsnews.com) and only +0.2% month-on-month. Core price growth remained slightly elevated (housing costs were a major driver), but overall price pressures were finally approaching the Federal Reserve’s 2% goal. The labor market, meanwhile, remained solid in April: employers added 177,000 jobs, and unemployment held at a low 4.2% (apnews.com). However, signs of strain emerged – consumer confidence slid for a fifth straight month to its weakest level since the pandemic’s onset (apnews.com). Economists attributed the dip in sentiment to trade-war uncertainty and hinted that the jobs “resilience” might soften in coming months.
New York City’s economy and real estate market stayed robust in May. NYC’s unemployment rate edged down to 4.8% (continuing a multi-month improvement) amid steady private-sector hiring. Demand for housing remained intense. Manhattan’s median apartment rent hit $4,571 – a record high and about 7.6% higher than a year earlier (ny1.com). It was the third time in four months that Manhattan rents set a new peak, underscoring persistent demand despite rising costs. Renters often faced bidding wars, with nearly 25% of new leases being signed above the asking price in May (ny1.com). Landlord concessions (like free rent) dwindled to scant levels. On the sales side, Manhattan home prices held firm – the median asking price (≈$1.1 million) was up modestly (~2–3% year-on-year), indicating no significant price declines in NYC’s housing market (zillow.com). Looking ahead, the combination of cooling inflation and trade-related risks suggests the Fed will remain on hold into the summer, a backdrop of stable rates that should keep credit conditions steady. Nonetheless, tariff uncertainty is a wild card. The Fed has signaled it has “flexibility to cut or hike” as needed (cbsnews.com). For now, NYC real estate clients can expect a competitive market to continue into early summer, with record rents and tight inventory, while keeping an eye on broader economic trends that could alter the second-half outlook.
