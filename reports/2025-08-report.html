August 2025 Market Report
By the end of August, clear signs of an economic slowdown had emerged, both nationally and in New York. The U.S. labor market essentially stalled in August, cementing expectations for imminent monetary easing. Employers added only 22,000 jobs in August – an extremely weak figure – and revised data showed the economy actually shed jobs in June for the first time since 2020 (reuters.comreuters.com). The unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, its highest level in almost four years (reuters.com). In fact, multiple indicators flashed warning signs: average weekly hours ticked down, job openings declined, and layoff announcements picked up. As one analyst put it, the economy is “skating as close to the edge of recession as you can get”(reuters.com). Much of the malaise was attributed to policy uncertainty – Trump’s import tariffs, immigration crackdowns, and even federal layoffs had led businesses to hunker down and halt hiring (reuters.com). Consumer spending also showed hints of strain by late summer, with confidence surveys and retail sales slowing. These developments “sealed the case” for a Federal Reserve rate cut in September (reuters.com), as Reuters noted. Indeed, investors in August were almost unanimously pricing in a Fed easing at the next meeting.
Inflation data, meanwhile, painted a mixed picture. The July CPI (released in August) held steady at 2.7% year-over-year, unchanged from June (tradingeconomics.com). This leveling off suggested that the initial burst of tariff-driven inflation had not (yet) accelerated further. Core inflation was also roughly stable around the 2.9% mark. There were notable shifts beneath the surface: energy prices, which had spiked in early summer, eased slightly in August as oil markets stabilized; conversely, certain consumer goods continued to rise in price due to the tariffs. The net effect was inflation running just above the Fed’s target but not spiraling – essentially well-contained, albeit a bit higher than earlier in the year. With the labor market now faltering and forward-looking inflation expectations still tame, the Fed grew more confident that it could provide stimulus without risking an inflationary spike. In public remarks at Jackson Hole in late August, Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that the Fed’s dual mandate had flipped: employment softness was the chief concern, while the recent price increases were expected to be “transitory” and likely to fade by next year (especially if trade tensions abated). As a result, the Fed strongly telegraphed that it was prepared to cut rates at the upcoming September meeting to support the weakening economy.
For New York City’s real estate market, late summer brought a turning point in rentals and continued resilience in sales. After five consecutive months of record highs, Manhattan rents finally plateaued in August. The median Manhattan rent declined slightly to $4,600, down 2.1% from July’s peak (credaily.com). This was the first month-over-month rent drop since early spring, signaling a welcome (if modest) reprieve for renters. Year-on-year, August rents were still 8.4% higher than a year ago (credaily.com), so affordability remains a challenge, but the end-of-summer cool-off suggests that landlords have started hitting the ceiling of what the market can bear. Multiple factors contributed: peak leasing seasonality began to ebb, a rush of new inventory hit the market (NYC’s rental listings were up ~18% vs. last year), and importantly, some demand shifted from renting to buying. Realtors report that falling mortgage rates – by late August, borrowing costs hit an 11-month low – have “opened the door for potential buyers, reducing rental demand in Manhattan.” (credaily.comcredaily.com) Indeed, August saw a noticeable uptick in first-time buyer interest, as many renters realized they could potentially purchase a home with lower financing costs on the horizon. Manhattan’s home sales market quietly gained momentum: one industry report noted Manhattan deal volume in August was the highest in nearly 2 years, defying national home-sale trends (brickunderground.com). Lower rates and the prospect of Fed cuts lured buyers back, which in turn eased some pressure in the rental market. Another dynamic in play was the FARE Act (the broker fee law) – some landlords held apartments off-market or adjusted strategies in response to the new rules, causing a temporary dip in listings in July/August (credaily.com). This likely will sort itself out in coming months as legal clarity improves, but in the short term it introduced a bit of noise in inventory counts.
Taken together, August 2025 may be remembered as the inflection point when the fever broke: the economy clearly downshifted, the Fed pivoted toward rate cuts, and NYC’s runaway rent surge moderated. For our clients, this environment carries implications. Renters should see more negotiating leverage going into the fall – the frantic pace of rent increases is poised to slow, and additional inventory (including new lease-ups in Brooklyn/Queens) offers more options. Prospective buyers face a potentially favorable setup: mortgage rates are likely to decline as the Fed eases policy, and any economic weakness could motivate sellers to be more flexible on price. Notably, outer-borough markets are still heating up (Brooklyn and Northwest Queens rents were still rising in August as priced-out Manhattanites look for value, with over one-third of Brooklyn leases seeing bidding wars) (credaily.comcredaily.com). But citywide, the tide is turning toward a more balanced market. Our forecast: With the Fed providing stimulus and inflation contained, the remainder of 2025 should bring gradually improving affordability – a much-needed breather after a period of intense price growth. We advise clients to stay alert for opportunities, whether locking in a lower mortgage rate or negotiating a better lease, as the market’s dynamics evolve heading into autumn.
