            <h4>Market Inflection Point Reached</h4>
            <p>
                After five consecutive months of record highs, Manhattan rents finally plateaued in August. The median rent declined 2.1% from July's peak—the first month-over-month drop since early spring, signaling a welcome reprieve for renters.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Economic Context -->
        <section class="report-section">
            <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
            
            <h3>Labor Market Essentially Stalled</h3>
            <p>
                Clear signs of an economic slowdown emerged in August. Employers added only 22,000 jobs—an extremely weak figure—and revised data showed the economy actually shed jobs in June for the first time since 2020. The unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, its highest level in almost four years.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Multiple indicators flashed warning signs: average weekly hours declined, job openings fell, and layoff announcements increased. As one analyst noted, the economy is "skating as close to the edge of recession as you can get." Much of the malaise was attributed to policy uncertainty from tariffs, immigration crackdowns, and federal layoffs leading businesses to halt hiring.
            </p>

            <h3>Inflation Stabilizes, Fed Pivot Confirmed</h3>
            <p>
                The July CPI (released in August) held steady at 2.7% year-over-year, unchanged from June. This leveling suggested that the initial burst of tariff-driven inflation had not accelerated further. Core inflation remained stable around 2.9%, with energy prices easing slightly as oil markets stabilized.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At Jackson Hole in late August, Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that the Fed's dual mandate had flipped: employment softness was now the chief concern, while recent price increases were expected to be "transitory." The Fed strongly telegraphed rate cuts at the September meeting to support the weakening economy.
            </p>

        <!-- NYC Market Analysis -->
        <section class="report-section">
            <h2>NYC Real Estate Analysis</h2>
            
            <h3>Rental Market Reaches Turning Point</h3>
            <p>
                After five consecutive months of record highs, Manhattan rents finally plateaued in August. The median rent declined slightly to $4,600, down 2.1% from July's peak. While year-over-year rents remain 8.4% higher, this first month-over-month drop signals that landlords have started hitting the ceiling of what the market can bear.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Multiple factors contributed to this shift: peak leasing seasonality began to ebb, new inventory hit the market (NYC's rental listings were up ~18% versus last year), and importantly, some demand shifted from renting to buying as mortgage rates fell to 11-month lows.
            </p>

            <h3>Sales Market Gains Momentum</h3>
            <p>
                Manhattan's home sales market quietly gained momentum, with August deal volume reaching the highest level in nearly 2 years, defying national trends. Lower rates and the prospect of Fed cuts lured buyers back, particularly first-time buyers exhausted by rental market competition.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Realtors report that falling mortgage rates have "opened the door for potential buyers, reducing rental demand in Manhattan." This reallocation from renting to owning represents a significant shift that could further soften rental demand going forward.
            </p>

            <h3>Outer Boroughs Still Hot</h3>
            <p>
                While Manhattan showed signs of cooling, outer-borough markets remained heated. Brooklyn and Northwest Queens rents continued rising as priced-out Manhattanites sought value, with over one-third of Brooklyn leases still seeing bidding wars.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Looking Ahead -->
        <section class="report-section">
            <h2>Market Outlook</h2>
            <p>
                August 2025 may be remembered as the inflection point when the fever broke: the economy clearly downshifted, the Fed pivoted toward rate cuts, and NYC's runaway rent surge moderated.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Implications for Market Participants</h3>
            
            <p><strong>For Renters:</strong> More negotiating leverage going into fall. The frantic pace of rent increases is poised to slow, and additional inventory (including new lease-ups in Brooklyn/Queens) offers more options. Expect landlords to become more flexible on terms.</p>
            
            <p><strong>For Buyers:</strong> A potentially favorable setup with mortgage rates likely to decline as the Fed eases policy. Any economic weakness could motivate sellers to be more flexible on price. Lock in lower rates when available.</p>
            
            <p><strong>For Investors:</strong> Watch for opportunities as the market rebalances. Some overleveraged landlords who bought at peak prices may need to sell, creating potential value opportunities.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Factors for Fall 2025</h3>
            <ul style="line-height: 2; margin-left: 20px;">
                <li>Fed rate cuts beginning September should lower mortgage rates further</li>
                <li>Rental inventory continuing to improve from extremely tight levels</li>
                <li>Economic data determining depth and duration of slowdown</li>
                <li>Outer-borough markets may see delayed cooling compared to Manhattan</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                With the Fed providing stimulus and inflation contained, the remainder of 2025 should bring gradually improving affordability—a much-needed breather after a period of intense price growth.
