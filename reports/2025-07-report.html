        <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>Rental Market at Peak Intensity</h4>
            <p>
                The 29% share of Manhattan leases involving bidding wars represents the highest level since tracking began in 2021. Many renters are offering above asking rent to secure apartments, driving summer rents higher earlier than usual.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Economic Context -->
        <section class="report-section">
            <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
            
            <h3>GDP Rebound Masks Underlying Weakness</h3>
            <p>
                The U.S. economy reported a surprising rebound with Q2 GDP expanding at a +3.3% annualized rate, after shrinking -0.5% in Q1. However, this sharp snap-back was largely a statistical mirage driven by trade fluctuations. Imports plunged nearly 30% in Q2 after businesses front-loaded purchases before tariffs hit, artificially boosting growth by over 5 percentage points.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Stripping away trade distortions and AI investment boom effects, underlying demand remained tepid with the economy growing only ~1.4% on average in the first half of 2025. This weak foundation suggests the headline GDP number significantly overstates economic health.
            </p>

            <h3>Inflation Turns Higher on Tariff Impact</h3>
            <p>
                Consumer prices in June rose 2.7% year-over-year, marking the fastest inflation since January and confirming that tariff pass-through has begun. Prices for groceries, appliances, and apparel moved higher as businesses factored in the cost of new import duties. Core CPI reached 2.9% year-over-year, while gasoline prices rebounded 1.0% amid Middle East tensions.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite this uptick, Federal Reserve officials expressed confidence that tariff-driven price increases would be "meaningful but not persistent," expecting inflation to run above target in coming months before fading in 2026.
            </p>

            <h3>Labor Market Reaches Critical Juncture</h3>
            <p>
                The June jobs report revealed only 73,000 jobs added after revisions—far below trend and evidence that hiring has almost stalled. While the unemployment rate remained around 4.2%-4.3%, more workers moved to the sidelines and job openings began declining. This dramatic cooling cemented Wall Street consensus that the Fed's first rate cut would occur in September.

        <!-- NYC Market Analysis -->
        <section class="report-section">
            <h2>NYC Real Estate Analysis</h2>
            
            <h3>Rental Market Reaches Unprecedented Heights</h3>
            <p>
                July's median Manhattan rent of $4,700 marks the fifth record high in six months and represents a 9.3% year-over-year increase. The rental market's intensity is without precedent—nearly 29% of new Manhattan leases involved bidding wars, the highest share since tracking began.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite these peaks, early signs of change are emerging. Manhattan listings are approximately 10% higher than a year ago, and landlords are beginning to price more cautiously heading into late summer. The gradual inventory improvement suggests the market may be approaching a turning point.
            </p>

            <h3>Sales Market Shows Renewed Life</h3>
            <p>
                The buy side of NYC's market displayed glimmers of strength thanks to changing interest rate expectations. Manhattan home sales contracts in late July reached their highest level in nearly two years, as some would-be renters pivoted to buying, sensing an opportunity before borrowing costs potentially fall further.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mortgage rates, while still elevated, dipped slightly on expectations of Fed cuts. This modest improvement was enough to unlock pent-up buyer demand, particularly among those exhausted by the rental market's competitive dynamics.
            </p>

            <h3>Local Economy Shows Mixed Signals</h3>
            <p>
                NYC's economy remained on solid footing with bustling tourism and strong Wall Street profits. However, the city is not immune to national trends—private-sector hiring slowed to a crawl with fewer than 1,000 net new jobs in the first half, aligning with the national cooldown.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Looking Ahead -->
        <section class="report-section">
            <h2>Market Outlook</h2>
            <p>
                By late summer, the pieces are in place for a significant market shift. The Federal Reserve has pivoted from a hiking bias earlier in the year to a clear easing bias by July, with the Fed Chair emphasizing that softening labor market trends and "fragile" business confidence warrant vigilance.
            </p>
            
            <h3>What This Means for NYC Real Estate</h3>
            
            <p><strong>For Renters:</strong> Expect one more month of very high rents in August, but relief is on the horizon. The combination of increasing inventory, Fed rate cuts, and some demand shifting to purchases should begin moderating rent growth.</p>
            
            <p><strong>For Buyers:</strong> The window of opportunity is opening. With Fed rate cuts likely beginning in September, mortgage rates should decline, improving affordability for the first time in years.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Market Dynamics to Watch:</strong></p>
            <ul style="line-height: 2; margin-left: 20px;">
                <li>Fed's September meeting likely to deliver first rate cut</li>
                <li>Rental inventory continuing to improve from tight levels</li>
                <li>Buyer activity increasing as mortgage rates anticipate Fed easing</li>
                <li>Economic data confirming or contradicting recession risks</li>
