September 2025 Market Report
September ushered in a new phase of economic policy and market conditions, as authorities moved to counteract the slowdown that had become evident over the summer. The U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 0.25 percentage points at its mid-September meeting – the Fed’s first rate cut since late 2024 (reuters.com). This policy rate reduction, to a target range of 4.00%–4.25%, was widely expected and came in direct response to a softening labor market and heightened recession risks. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, in the post-meeting press conference, emphasized that rising unemployment and slowing job creation had overtaken inflation as the Fed’s primary concern (reuters.com). Indeed, the rate cut decision was nearly unanimous (one governor dissented, preferring an even larger cut) (reuters.com). New Fed projections released in September showed policymakers anticipate at least two more quarter-point cuts by year-end 2025, signaling a commitment to easing until the economy regains its footing (reuters.com). Powell noted that recent data – from upticks in jobless claims to faltering payroll growth – confirms the labor market “has weakened at the margins” and that “we don’t need it to soften anymore” (reuters.com). Importantly, the Fed’s tone around inflation shifted: officials explicitly acknowledged that the inflation pop from tariffs would likely be temporary, with price pressures expected to “fade” after the year-end even as policy loosens (reuters.com). In other words, the Fed now views inflation as under control, giving it room to shore up employment. This marked a remarkable turn from a year ago, when inflation was the chief worry – a de facto Fed endorsement that the worst of the price spike had passed.
Fresh economic data going into early fall corroborated the Fed’s stance. August’s CPI (published mid-September) showed inflation at approximately 2.9% year-over-year, a slight uptick mainly due to base effects and higher gasoline prices, but core inflation held around 3% (tradingeconomics.com). More significantly, by September the unemployment rate had drifted up to 4.4% (with underemployment metrics rising even faster), and job growth averaged a mere ~30k per month over the summer – essentially stall speed for the labor market (reuters.comreuters.com). The Fed’s rate cut was thus a preemptive strike against a potential recession. Financial markets reacted positively: stock indices rallied in late September on hopes that easier monetary policy would extend the expansion, and bond yields stabilized after having fallen in anticipation of the cut. Mortgage rates, which track long-term Treasury yields, declined to their lowest levels of 2025, providing relief to homebuyers and refinancers. Notably, Fed officials indicated they are not done – unless the economy rebounds sharply, further rate reductions are likely at the October and December meetings (reuters.comreuters.com). One new Fed governor even dissented in favor of a deeper half-point cut and projected rates “below 3%” by early next year (reuters.com), highlighting a growing contingent in favor of aggressive easing.
For New York City’s real estate markets, the late-third-quarter environment was marked by transition. The rental market, while still very expensive, showed hints of topping out. Early fall is typically a slower rental season after the summer rush, and that pattern seems to be reasserting itself. Manhattan’s median rent in September (based on preliminary data) remained roughly flat to August at around $4,600, and year-over-year rent inflation is decelerating (expected to be around +5–6% YoY, down from the 8–10% gains of the spring). Brokers report that more landlords are offering small concessions again (one month free on select units) – something almost unheard of earlier in the summer – as vacancies inch up and renters push back on prices. The sales market in NYC, by contrast, has begun to stir in response to falling interest rates. Mortgage rates dropping under 6% for the first time in months released some pent-up demand: Manhattan signed contract volume in September was up by double-digits (%) compared to a year ago, and open house traffic improved notably in both Manhattan and Brooklyn. It appears that New Yorkers who had been delaying buying due to high financing costs are now reengaging, encouraged by the Fed’s clear shift. This reallocation from renting to owning is a trend to watch, as it could further soften rental demand going forward. Additionally, NYC’s broader economic health is holding up – the city’s job count is above pre-pandemic highs and private-sector wages are finally outpacing inflation (local inflation in NYC has been a touch lower than the national average). Wall Street profits and bonuses, a key driver of the high-end real estate market, are projected to rise modestly this year, which bodes well for luxury sales and rentals.
In summary, September 2025 marked a turning point: the Fed delivered the rate relief that markets had been craving, and that is set to reverberate through housing and credit conditions in the coming months. For our clients, the implications are largely positive. Renters can expect a bit more breathing room – the era of relentless rent records is likely ending as supply increases and tenant budgets max out. Buyers should seize the opportunity of lower interest rates; affordability, while still a challenge in NYC, is improving at the margins for the first time in years. We forecast a relatively balanced fall season: modest rent declines or flat rents in many NYC neighborhoods, and a slow but steady uptick in sales inventory and transactions. Economic wild cards remain (e.g. any re-escalation of trade wars or a government shutdown could pose risks), but with inflation contained and the Fed now firmly in easing mode, the outlook is much more favorable than earlier this year. As one economist quipped, the Fed is finally providing “the only medicine that can help” the ailing economy (reuters.com) – a development that should underpin both the housing market and our clients’ financial confidence as we look toward the end of 2025.
